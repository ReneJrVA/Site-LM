                    Hello, my name is Lethicia Matos, I am 24 years, Brazilian, living in Belgium since 2019.
                    Since my childhood i am passionate about photographing people and moments, when I was 17, I got my
                    first
                    câmera
                    and since then I have been transforming my vision in souvenirs.
                    As a portrait photographer I am to bring satisfaction and joy to my clients, I like to show how my
                    heart
                    is
                    involved in each click made by me.
                    Everything done with love becomes something that brings satisfaction and my professional and
                    personal
                    goal
                    in
                    life is that this feeling is never lacking on my work. The câmera is my tool and through it I give a
                    reason
                    to
                    everything that’s around me.
                </p>
